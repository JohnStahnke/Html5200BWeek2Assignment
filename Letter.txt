Dear *Mom and Dad* *Brother* *Sister* *Pet Dog* *Pet Cat* *Tax Accountant* ,
I am at *Camp* *the Gym* *School* *the grocery store* *the hospital*

I would like to let you know I am *Ok* *Broke* *getting pet food* *getting a cast*.
Please let *Mom and Dad* *Brother* *Sister* *Pet Dog* *Pet Cat* *Tax Accountant* out to go to the bathroom.

And then can you feed *Mom and Dad* *Brother* *Sister* *Pet Dog* *Pet Cat* *Tax Accountant* dinner, since I won't make it home.
I am having troubles with *car* *airplane* *magic carpet* as it sat *all night* *in the rain* *is mad at me*.

I will see you *soon* *tomorrow* *next week* *never*.

Love your *son* *pet rabbit* *daughter* *Uncle* *Proctoligist*.
